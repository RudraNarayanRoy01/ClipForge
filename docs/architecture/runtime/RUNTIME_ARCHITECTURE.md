# Adaptive AI Runtime Architecture

## Overview
The Adaptive AI Runtime is a first-class subsystem designed to orchestrate AI computation independently of providers and hardware. It decouples the core domain and application layers from the rapidly changing AI toolchain ecosystem.

## Responsibilities
- Abstract AI capabilities from concrete providers.
- Route execution requests to the optimal provider/hardware combination.
- Discover and manage local/remote capabilities dynamically.
- Enforce execution policies, optimizations, and telemetry independently of the application logic.

## Boundaries
- **Upper Boundary (Application Layer)**: Exposes abstract AI interfaces. The Application layer requests "Reasoning" or "Transcription" without knowing how it runs.
- **Lower Boundary (Infrastructure/Hardware)**: Integrates with specific Provider SDKs (Ollama, Gemini) and discovers hardware constraints (CUDA, VRAM).

## Runtime Dependency Direction

The explicit dependency direction introduced by Runtime Context:

```text
Application
↓
Runtime Bootstrap
↓
Runtime Context
↓
Runtime Lifecycle
↓
Runtime Extension Points
↓
Future Runtime Components
```

This dependency direction must remain stable. The Runtime must NEVER depend upward on specific Domain features (e.g., Campaign Intelligence).

## Runtime Terminology
- **Capability**: A generalized AI function (e.g., "Text Generation", "Transcription").
- **Provider**: A concrete implementation capable of providing a Capability (e.g., Ollama, Gemini).
- **Resource**: Underlying hardware or network constraint (e.g., GPU VRAM).
- **Planner**: Determines *how* to satisfy a requested Capability.
- **Scheduler**: Determines *when* and *where* to execute the plan.
- **Registry**: The catalog of available Capabilities and Providers.

## Runtime Core Composition

The Runtime is structured around a stable `core` package, which defines the foundational architectural framework. 
The canonical representation of the Runtime instance is the **Runtime Context**. 
Every future Runtime subsystem should communicate through the `RuntimeContext` rather than directly referencing `RuntimeBootstrap`, `RuntimeLifecycleCoordinator`, or Extension Points.

```

### Runtime Context Stability
The `RuntimeContext` is designed as a stable composition object. After construction:
- Lifecycle reference remains stable.
- Metadata reference remains stable.
- Extension Point collection remains stable.

Future Runtime modules should consume these references rather than replacing them.

### Runtime Metadata
The `RuntimeMetadata` object is descriptive only. It exists to describe the Runtime instance (e.g., Runtime Version, Runtime Identifier, Build Profile).
**RuntimeMetadata must NOT become:**
- Runtime Configuration
- Provider Configuration
- Hardware Configuration
- Runtime Settings
These concepts belong to future Runtime configuration modules.

### Extension Point Responsibilities
Extension Points:
- Expose Runtime integration surfaces.
- Define Runtime extensibility.
- Support the Open/Closed Principle.

Extension Points **should NOT**:
- Execute Runtime logic.
- Discover capabilities.
- Discover hardware.
- Manage lifecycle.
- Schedule execution.
- Instantiate providers.
These responsibilities belong to future Runtime components.

### Runtime Lifecycle
The Runtime coordinates operations through explicit lifecycle states:
`UNINITIALIZED -> BOOTSTRAPPING -> INITIALIZED -> SHUTTING_DOWN -> SHUTDOWN`

## Runtime Technical Debt Register

To prevent architectural overlap and provide a clear roadmap, execution and provider features are intentionally deferred:

**Deferred to Batch 6.1.4**
- Capability Registry

**Deferred to Batch 6.1.5**
- Resource Discovery

**Deferred to later Sprint**
- Provider Runtime
- Scheduler
- Execution Engine
- Hardware Discovery
- Runtime Optimization

The Runtime is being built progressively:

**Sprint 6.1**
↓
Foundation (Boundaries, Context & Composition)
↓
